# Project Overview

ECHOESâ€™ mission is to set up the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH), a shared platform designed to facilitate collaboration among heritage professionals and researchers, enabling them to modernise their workflows and processes. This platform will offer access to data, cutting-edge scientific and training resources, and advanced digital tools, all developed collaboratively by the heritage community to meet their specific requirements. ECHOES will integrate the currently fragmented communities within the Cultural Heritage (CH) sector, bringing together diverse actors from various fields and disciplines into a cohesive community focused on the Digital Commons.

# Partners

ECHOES covers 15 EU member states but also ensures a wider representativeness and inclusivity thanks to several institutions associated to pan-European networks and initiatives. These institutions are active in a wide range of topics as such as language as social and cultural data, art, archaeology, museums, archives, libraries, monuments and sites, conservation-restoration, cultural management, media culture, digital cultural heritage, intangible heritage and more. In this way, all CH sectors are represented in ECHOES. Moreover, several universities, research institutions and companies operating at different scales with complementary skills have been selected to manage the building of the ECCH platform.
